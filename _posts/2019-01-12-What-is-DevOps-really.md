title: What is DevOps really

Lately, I started to receive some contacts from recruiting people offering me some interesting job position as "DevOps Engineer", but after an analysis of those offerings I always discovered that the job is really an "IT Operation" position.  
So, I started to looking for some "DevOps Engineer" job position in IT companies... and I noticed a little bit of misundersanding, in my opinion, about DevOps.

As we all know, there is no standard definition about _what is DevOps_, but, as the term suggest, it should be a mix of _Development_ and _Operations_.  
So, a **DevOps Engineer** is an engineer that:
- could develop and review an application
- could use a source code management tool (e.g. Git)
- could use Continuous Integration tools (e.g. Jenkins)
- could test an application
- could monitor an application
- could configure and manage an infrastructure where an application could run 

A DevOps Engineer is a developer, a tester, an IT Operation guy, a reviewer, etc.
He (or she) applies Agile Methodologies in his (her) works, and he (she) could be interested in Security, Data Analytics and/or Site Reliability Engine, depending on the project he (she) is working on.

In my honest opinion, a job position regarding a DevOps Engineer must include all those aspects.
