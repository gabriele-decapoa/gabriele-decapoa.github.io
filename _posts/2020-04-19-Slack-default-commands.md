The way we work is continuously changing: we need to interact with each other more frequently, in an asynchronous mode, in any different place.

At the beginning there was [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), but this chat protocol is not so secure.
So, many applications was developed during the years to improve collaborations; one of those is Slack.

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-it/) is an Instant Messaging software, that allows to group your discussions in channels, make them private, contact a person directly also via voice and video call.
It could be a very useful collaboration tool, if you use it in right way.
Like other programms, Slack defines keyboard shortcuts to improve usability, but defines also [*commands*](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201259356-Built-in-slash-commands) as additional shortcut for periodic actions, like enable "Do Not Disturb" mode, set up a reminder or invite an user into a channel.
