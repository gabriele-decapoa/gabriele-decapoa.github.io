I was reading [this interesting article on IBM Cloud Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/12/logging-and-error-handling-in-the-cloud/) and I started to think: "Damn, this guy is right!"  
Logs are very important for enterprise application, but understand how many log rows and at which level write them is the question.
