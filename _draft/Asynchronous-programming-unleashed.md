As you know, there are many programming paradigms: imperative, object-oriented, event-oriented, etc.
What I discovered during these years is an hidden programming paradigms, based on concurrent paradigms: the _asynchronous programming_.

The asynchronous programming paradigm is how the callback functions (or subroutines) works.  
During the standard behavior of your program, every function invocation define a new frame in the stack.
